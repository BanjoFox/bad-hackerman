# omega_virus-python
This is a repo for the python port of the "Command Center" (the bit that talks and has buttons on it) used in the Omega Virus board game.
Why? Because Omega Virus is a fun game, and replacement copies are expensive. Therefore a version which does not require proprietary hardware is necessary in order to increase its lifespan :D
