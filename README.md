# The Omega Virus, FOSS Edition
Omega Virus is a talking board game from 1992 that I used to play all the time.  My copy still works, but I fear for it's continued existence.  Copies are selling for $200+ USD, but they still have the same problem of aging hardware.  I -want- to dump the firmware out of it at some point, but for now I was thinking about trying to replicate it programatically.  The rules are simple enough, and I have the architecture all written out.

Also the VOICE of the virus is FREAKING awesome... its so... sarcastic, and hatefull hahahah :D
when I can afford it I will probably buy one or two additional copies when I get the hardware hacking book.  Because 1 is none and 2 is one

This is a repo for the python port of the "Command Center" (the bit that talks and has buttons on it) used in the Omega Virus board game.
Why? Because Omega Virus is a fun game, and replacement copies are expensive. Therefore a version which does not require proprietary hardware is necessary in order to increase its lifespan :D
