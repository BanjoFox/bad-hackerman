TODO:

-- Open Game, make a proper list of rooms.
-- Add movement rules (Players can only move three spaces) #Do we want to enforce this?
-- Add attack rules. (Virus can only be defeated if: Player is in same room as virus AND has all three weapons).
-- Add player inventory tracking. This is important!
-- Add discovery exceptions. If player has an item, they are not allowed to find duplicates. 
-- Code some stuff!
